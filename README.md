# Enchant Check

Enchant Check allows you to quick-check your gear or the gear of the player you are currently inspecting: It shows a short report which tells you:

* If all equipped gear is enchanted
* If all sockets have gems
* If there are any empty equipment slots
* If you wear items with very low item-level compared to your average item-level (e.g., Fishing Poles, Cooking Hats)

It does NOT tell you, whether you chose the right enchants, gems, or items. It simply serves as a quick way to tell you where you need to look.
